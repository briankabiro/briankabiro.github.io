It’s been a year since I started speed watching videos and I noticed that recently I’ve been watching videos at 3x the speed.

I started watching videos at higher speeds after Siraj Raval recommended it on one of his [videos](https://youtu.be/nxWfZP6eslM) about how learning faster. At the time I was faced with the daunting task of watching numerous video tutorials and it seemed like a good thing to pick up.

Since then, I have speed watched movies, tutorials and recently started speeding up slow songs to make them more dance-worthy.

The one thing that I’ve taken away from this is that the brain adapts. I didn’t start off at thrice the speed. For a long time, I used to do 1.5x and slowly eased up to 2x. 

When I’m watching a video, I also like to increase the speed until the point where I don’t comprehend what’s being said. This is a handy trick of making sure I am being as efficient as possible.

There are times when you've adjusted the speed but you still want to see how high you can push it. 
 
For example, let's say I am aiming for 2x speed. I speed it up to something like 2.5x and then listen to it for a bit. I then turn down to 2x and sort of trick my brain into adapting to the lower speed that I am really aiming for.

Many people are skeptical when I tell them that I watch at these speeds. The first thing that comes to mind is movies and how it would affect the experience. 

I don’t watch movies at 3x the speed but I definitely watch them at above 1.5x. The only time I do normal(1x) is because of internet speeds and I don’t want to wait for the stream to load before hand.

The Video Speed Controller browser add-on is available for both Firefox and Chrome. It has some handy keyboard short-cuts for adjusting the speed. 

We live in a consumerist world where there are a million things asking for our attention. It could be a tutorial, some sports highlights, a movie or even Instagram. For that reason, it’s important to make sure that we cut time wherever we can.

It’s been proven that it might not be possible to speed read but speed watching is definitely possible. Give it a try.
