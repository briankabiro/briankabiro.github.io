Becoming a millionaire is a benchmark that is appealing and a goal that many want to reach financially. It is a good thing but in countries with weaker currencies, this definition needs to be redefined. 

That is, which currency are you looking at it from?

The _personal_ standard for defining a millionaire should not be country-specific but be defined by a particular currency(the US dollar maybe).

If a country has a weak currency, the threshold of a millionaire isn’t as high as someone in a country with a strong currency. It means that we don’t set high enough goals because we are limited by our currencies. 

Your goal might be big but theirs is bigger when they are compared. 

My hypothesis in this article is that people working towards being millionaires in stable countries have more ambition than their counterparts in countries with weaker currencies.  

The same logic can be applied to being a billionaire but I chose not to include that and focus on the millionaire stage because it’s the first step. 

One way of doing this is for banks to allow you to see your balance in a stronger currency. 
Perspective might cause you not to be contented based on the figure. Suddenly that hundred thousand is reduced to 1000 dollars. 

Dreaming bigger has an impact as it forces you to have a different perspective to things and life in general. The other advantage of setting high enough goals is that although we might not reach that goal, we will have done more than we imagined. 

I wrote this article with Kenya in mind where our shilling is trading at 100 to $1. 

Things need to get better; dreaming bigger might one of the ways that we get there.
