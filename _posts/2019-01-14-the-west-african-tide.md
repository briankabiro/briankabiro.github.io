I like Kenyan music. Scratch that, I adore Kenyan music. To some of my fellow country-men, that's an abomination. It's funny to think that there would be a day when someone that says that they love their country's music would be met with disgust.

To be clear, I don't like all music that comes from our great nation just as nobody loves every song with an Afro-beat. Otherwise, all of your phone storage would be full from all the songs you would have to save.

The <insert Nigerian or Tanzanian> wave has swept Kenya up and carried us away similar to how the Standard Gauge Railway carries people to and fro Mombasa. 

It's also funny that all West African music is attributed to Nigeria. I don't know whether it's because most don't know which countries are in West Africa or it's because Nigerian movies laid the groundwork. 

Personally, I developed a distaste to West African music as a way of lashing out to the "other side", my enemies in music taste. For one, it's the go-to genre for some DJs these days that are "lazy" and don't go out to find good music.

What I'm hoping to address is the notion that ALL Kenyan product is poor. Is it? I don't know and you can't know either. This means that I can't tell you whether your taste is poor or mine is better. Taste can't be quantified; we can only have differing preferences.
As to why people are against Kenyan music, I don't have a good answer to that yet. What's up with the argument that I only like Nyashinski's music? It would be interesting to know why this is so.
So can we all make up once and for all and agree to disagree without insulting each other.
