> Everyone thinks of changing the world, but no one thinks of changing himself. - Leo Tolstoy

By now, you’ve heard that the Amazon is burning. Everyone is freaking out about it. I myself was guilty of the same.

“*Something needs to be done, we are doomed if we continue to kill the lungs of the earth*”.

“*The Brazilian president needs to go for allowing this to happen*”.

These were the thoughts that were running through my head as I read about the situation and how it was getting worse.

And then it hit me, complaining and worrying about what is happening to the Amazon will not change anything. Protesting on social media will do little to change things.

The solution is simple: **plant a tree** and then another one and then another one. If that is hard to do, it is possible for me to donate to an organization that plants trees or one that is doing something towards making the environment better.

In closing, I have decided to be like Bezos and start my own "Amazon"--one that I can control.
