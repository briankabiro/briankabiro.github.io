For a long time, I was skeptical about writing and performing poetry. My reason was that I could always write a song and communicate the message through music. I like making music and saw it as a one-size-fits-all creative outlet.

I've had an idea for a story about modern relationships in today's society and felt that it was time to communicate it to the world. I tried to write it in a song but that was easier said than done. I immediately felt discouraged when I started thinking about all the elements that go into making a song.

I realized that there were some stories that I didn't need to tell using music. I would just be forcing the creative process and making it harder for myself.

I now know that I have poetry and spoken word as an option. Let's see how that goes.
