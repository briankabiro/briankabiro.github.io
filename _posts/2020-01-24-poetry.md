For a long time, I was skeptical about writing and performing poetry. My excuse was that I could always write a song and communicate the message through music.

I got an idea for a piece recently and tried to write it in a song. Let's just say that it was easier than said that done. I immediately felt discouraged when I started thinking about all the elements that go into making a song.

I realized that there were some stories that I didn't need to tell using music. I would just be forcing the creative process and making it harder for myself. 

I now know that I have poetry and spoken word as an option. Let's see how that goes.
